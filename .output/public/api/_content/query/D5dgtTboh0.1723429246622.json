At the same time I thought about how each family member's\nactions and words would affect each other. Then I thought about the circle outside my family that we were\ninfluencing and being influenced by, how everybody's actions and words affect each other.

For some reason it felt like entitlement recently became a subtle common thing with\neverybody in this generation. So I wondered, why is that? I continued with this train of thought and found myself\nconnecting the dots with wishlists. I knew wishlist isn't the root cause of entitlement, but I couldn't shake off the\nthought that it could affect it. I thought about it more.
