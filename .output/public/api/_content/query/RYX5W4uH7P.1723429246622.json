I believe it will help me understand myself better. Now that I'm into journaling, I couldn't agree more when Aaron said, \"year in reviews is a helpful exercise\".

These were things we knew are beneficial for her development. Also, friends and family visited more often. We had a bigger space to host dinners and parties.

So far, so good; we're happy with what we're seeing from our daughterâ€”the habits and manners she's picking up from school have been great!

We had a Shopify store and Facebook for our online channels. We were working on pairing with hospitals to include our diapers as part of their newborn kits. And we were trying to find resellers and sub distributors. We started off the business with excitement, but as months passed my wife and I realized this just wasn't working for us. Many times, we didn't know what we were doing. Warehousing and logistics were difficult! Finding a reliable delivery rider was tough. Our last rider stole a few days worth of cash-on-delivery collection. Resolving issues with customers was draining and sometimes frustrating. I think we could have figured all these issues out if we stuck with it, but given our family's current situation, we couldn't. We were more focused with other areas of our life. So we decided to part ways with my college friend, and gave him all of our company shares as we exited that business."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"em","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Then there's work at my day job."}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"My day job was something I really enjoyed. I loved the people I work with and I love the things we're building. Q1 this year, the company underwent a merger and upper management when through an overhaul. Unfortunately, company changes involved a bunch of layoffs. I was asked to select a few members from my team to let go. It was a tough decision and I had to break the news to them myself. As a team lead, it's heartbreaking to let go of people you love working with and who did no wrong. Since the layoffs, the team engagement dropped and enthusiasm to work flatlined. From there moving forward, everybody was just going thru the motions. For the rest of the year, there was a hovering feeling of job insecurity. To make the long story short, the company eventually shut down the entire Philippine team in Q4 this year."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Despite all the events within the company, it was still a productive year for me.
